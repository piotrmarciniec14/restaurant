1)dishes in menu are pizzas. They are represented by dictionaries. First version includes pizza name, price. Thing to add are: ingredients (as a list), price for small size, big size, availibility
2)waiter asks for number of people, then collects order asking everyone seperately. then asks about drinks. 
3)menu displayed should show every info in the same column. using tabulator works seperately for each dish. Write function that checks for max length of each parameter (for example longest name of pizza is frutti di mare which is 17 characters so information about price should always start after 17+5 characters. In frutti di mare i have to add 5 spaces but in salami 11+5 spaces)
